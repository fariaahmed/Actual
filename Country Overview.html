          <h4>United Kingdom</h4>
          <p>Climate change is causing warming across the UK. All of the UK's ten warmest years on record have occurred since 2002. Heatwaves, like that of summer 2018, are now 30 times more likely to happen due to climate change.

              UK winters are projected to become warmer and wetter on average, although cold or dry winters will still occur sometimes. </p>
              
              <p>Summers are projected to become hotter and are more likely to be drier, although wetter summers are also possible. By 2050, heatwaves like that seen in 2019 are expected to happen every other year.

              Even if we do reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sea levels around the UK will keep rising beyond 2100. Parts of the UK will be in danger of flooding, with low lying and coastal cities at particular risk.

              Heavy rainfall is also more likely. Since 1998, the UK has seen seven of the ten wettest years on record. The winter storms in 2015 were at least 40% more likely because of climate change. </p>

            <h4>Bangladesh</h4>
            <p>Bangladesh is exceptionally vulnerable to climate change. Its low elevation, high population density and inadequate infrastructure all put the nation in harm’s way, along with an economy that is heavily reliant on farming.

                Because of the country’s natural susceptibility to extreme weather, the people of Bangladesh have always used migration as a coping strategy. 
                <p>However, as conditions intensify under climate change, more people are being driven from their homes and land by more frequent and severe hazards. Sea level rise, storms, cyclones, drought, erosion, landslides, flooding and salinization are already displacing large numbers of people.</p>

                It has been estimated that by 2050, one in every seven people in Bangladesh will be displaced by climate change. Up to 18 million people may have to move because of sea level rise alone. </p>

            <h4>Maldives</h4>
            <p>Maldives is at major risk of flooding at all times. Tsunamis are also apparent as there are many hazard zones in the Maldives, which are spread in a nucleated fashion.
                The sea levels across the globe is rising, which displays a long-term, increasing trend. </p> 
                <p>The Maldives are no exception from the rising sea levels, and it has many consequences upon them.
                Tsunami hazard zones are common in the Maldives due to the low elevation of the Maldives, it's tsunami prone. The hazard zones are spread in a nucleated fashion since the nation is heavily spread out into smaller islands. </p>
                <p> The low elevation also makes the island nation very sensitive to sea level rise, as just a few centimeter increase can destroy the homes of many.
                All of these factors are important as this information helps us identify many issues that the Maldives go against. Identifying the patterns of tsunamis could help identify where to enforce protection, and identifying trends help us understand in what time frame effects from climate change will take place.
